  "description": "## Description This website is about doing good deeds and living #THEGOODLIFE. Sometime back I realized that all the main news in the media seemed to be negative. More recently it has even been regarded as FAKE. I however look forward to a day when everyone is doing GOOD DEEDS FOR ONE ANOTHER and all news IS GOOD. The website presents a speech I gave at the Art of Speaking Toastmasters Club in North Edison, NJ library in August of 2015. Ths website allows you to print the Certificate of Awesomeness for doing 3 good deeds. By doing so it self certifies you as an Awesome person that is making this world a better place. Feel free to print one out for yourself and others. As a member of mankind....Are you a team player? Do GOOD DEEDS!",
